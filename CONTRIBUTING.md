All work in the repository is released under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. For your submission to be considered for inclusion, please include the following statement in each of your submissions. (A simple copy and paste will do.)

> By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
>
> (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses; or
>
> (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses; or

If the statement is not included your submission will not be included in any release of Sqon. You will likely be notified that the statement is missing and you will have time to correct that mistake.

Please note that open issues and pull requests that are inactive for 30 days will be labeled as "inactive" and closed. The issue or pull request may only be reopened if new activity is available (e.g. new comment, new/changed commits).

Style Guide
-----------

Code submissions must follow the [PSR-2][] coding style guide.

[PSR-2]: http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/

Issues
------

When creating a new issue, please provide as much detail as you can about the issue in the description. If the issue is a bug, please provide a minimal code sample that will replicate the issue for everyone else. Please be sure to also specify the version or commit number of the library that you are using. The title of the issue should be a summary of the description that includes the subject (e.g. "The bootstrap script") and problem (e.g. "does not have a shebang line.").

If you find that you are affected by an open issue, please use GitHub's reactions to share how it affects. Using `+1` indicates that the issue also impacts you, `-1` if you feel that the issue will have a negative impact on you, and `Heart` if the issue is something on your wishlist. Posting a comment to the same effect will be deleted. Please only post comments if you are able to provide additional relevant information.
